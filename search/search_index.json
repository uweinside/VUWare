Rather than build a walled garden, forcing customers to use our proprietary application, we wanted the VU1 to be open to everyone. This would allow the VU1 to be used in scenarios far beyond our limited imagination and, more importantly, be utilized by ANY other apps or purpose. Continuing to develop the demo app would run contrary to that vision, and we see it as a stop-gap solution until 3rd party apps incorporate native support. In the near future, we expect that as VU1 adoption grows, the demo app will become redundant.\"</p> <p>While that's a valid approach, it also adds complexity (installation, startup), modest performance penalties (HTTP communication), and adoption has been slow. Moreover, the use of the open-source LibreHardwareMonitor sensor access library is problematic because it lags behind modern hardware. On some systems, important sensor values simply aren't available.</p>"},{"location":"#why-vuware","title":"Why VUWare?","text":"<p>Many users want a solution for their dials that is:</p> <ul> <li>Easy to install and use</li> <li>Automatically detects and configures the dials</li> <li>Supports modern hardware for monitoring</li> <li>Uses minimal system resources</li> </ul> <p>VUWare was created to meet these needs. It's based on a C# library that communicates with the dials via serial port in a straightforward manner. This library can be used in any C# project and will soon be published as a NuGet package.</p> <p>VUWare.App is the monitoring application that reads sensor data and sends it to the dials. It's based on HWInfo64\u2014the well-known commercial solution that's free for non-commercial use. While HWInfo64 limits exports to 3rd party apps to 12 hours (which is plenty for most users), the app runs minimized in the system tray and uses almost no resources thanks to modern async patterns designed to be as unobtrusive as possible.</p> <p>We now have the best of both worlds: Sasa's open vision for the VU1 platform, and a ready-to-use solution that just works!</p>"},{"location":"#key-features","title":"Key Features","text":""},{"location":"#real-time-hardware-monitoring","title":"Real-Time Hardware Monitoring","text":"<ul> <li>Display any HWInfo64 sensor on physical VU1 analog dials</li> <li>Monitor up to 4 sensors simultaneously (one per dial)</li> <li>Automatic color changes based on configurable warning and critical thresholds</li> <li>Live updates with configurable polling intervals (default: 1 second)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#easy-configuration","title":"Easy Configuration","text":"<ul> <li>Graphical settings interface for configuring dials</li> <li>Browse and select from all available HWInfo64 sensors</li> <li>Set custom minimum/maximum ranges for each dial</li> <li>Configure warning and critical threshold values</li> <li>Choose colors for normal, warning, and critical states</li> <li>Upload custom dial face images for personalization</li> </ul> <p>Graphical settings interface for configuring dials</p>"},{"location":"#first-run-setup-wizard","title":"First-Run Setup Wizard","text":"<ul> <li>Automatic detection of connected VU1 Gauge Hub</li> <li>Discovery of all connected dials via I2C</li> <li>Guided configuration for first-time users</li> <li>HWInfo64 sensor browser for easy sensor selection</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#status-monitoring","title":"Status Monitoring","text":"<ul> <li>Visual status indicators for system state</li> <li>Real-time dial percentage display with color coding</li> <li>Detailed tooltips showing sensor values and update information</li> <li>Error reporting and diagnostics</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#what-you-need","title":"What You Need","text":""},{"location":"#hardware","title":"Hardware","text":"<ul> <li>VU1 Gauge Hub - Connected via USB</li> <li>VU1 Analog Dials - 1 to 4 dials connected to the hub via I2C</li> <li>Windows PC - Windows 10 version 1809 or later (64-bit)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#software","title":"Software","text":"<ul> <li>HWInfo64 - Must be installed and running with \"Shared Memory Support\" enabled</li> <li>USB Serial Driver - Usually installed automatically by Windows</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#quick-start","title":"Quick Start","text":"<ol> <li>Install VUWare - Download and run the installer</li> <li>Connect Hardware - Plug in your VU1 Hub and dials</li> <li>Launch HWInfo64 - Enable \"Shared Memory Support\" in settings</li> <li>Run VUWare - The setup wizard will guide you through configuration</li> <li>Monitor - Watch your sensors come to life on analog dials!</li> </ol> <p>VUWare main window showing real-time sensor monitoring on VU1 dials</p> <p>First Time Users</p> <p>The first-run setup wizard makes configuration easy.
